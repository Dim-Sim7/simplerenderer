TODO::

Upload stuff to device, call the kernel, refactor for real-time running of scene (figure out how to do)

once this is all done, implement point cloud and line rendering

do the same for CPU and then profile the perfomance on each renderer. (far --> close)

explain difference of tile-based GPU rendering to CPU rendering

talk about tradeoffs and design decisions and future improvements

use Nvidia Nsight and another performance measurer

clean up code, clean up repo, add docs 

finish project









/////////////WHAT TO DO NEXT/////////

-COMBINE CPU AND GPU RENDERER INTO ONE FILE STRUCUTRE

// FIGURE OUT BEST WAY TO PROFILE
-PROFILE THIS BUILD WITH EACH TEXTURE SHADING (FIX PAGED MEM COPY FROM DTOH AT END)
-PROFILE THE CPU BUILD

display perfomance of cpu first with. outline the issues

show how gpu renderer fixed the issues and improved performance

show tradeoffs between the two

make a simple CLI UI. 

1. enter path to obj FILE
2. render with cpu or gpu
3. pick your shader
4. display image and show the performance
